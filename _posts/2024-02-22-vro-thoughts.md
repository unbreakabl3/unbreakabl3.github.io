I am a big fan of VMware Aria Automation and VMware Aria Orchestrator (formerly vRealize Orchestrator) especially. I followed up on [this](https://github.com/vmware/build-tools-for-vmware-aria) project since it wasn't public yet, and from the beginning, it would open almost endless horizons for what we'll be able to do once it is publicly available. But I didn't realize how humble I was in my thoughts...
I started to test it after it became an open source. And... I fell in love. But there was one catch - I would need to learn TypeScript. And I fell in love the second time :)
After a few years of using vRO (I can't stop calling it vRO) before the moment, I discovered the Build Tools were gone in a second. I started to feel like a real programmer (haha). No `var a = ...` anymore. Welcome Classes, Types, and Promises, and - Unit-Tests! Welcome endless (almost) possibilities, even with the old Mozilla Rhino Engine 1.7R4 Aria Orchestrator uses. It's like two different products - vRO with web client and Javascript and vRO with VSCode + Typescript.

I will share some code and tips I collected using Aria Orchestrator with the Building Tools. And I highly recommend using it.

I want to thank each developer who did this project and continue supporting it. THANK YOU!
