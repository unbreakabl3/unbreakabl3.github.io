# About

Hey there!

Iâ€™m Leo, and Iâ€™m thrilled to welcome you to my corner of the internet. As an avid explorer of all things tech, Iâ€™ve found my passion lies at the intersection of VMware Aria Automation, cloud wizardry, and the art of automation.

Why am I so obsessed with these topics? Well, itâ€™s simple: I believe that technology should empower us, not overwhelm us. Whether itâ€™s orchestrating complex workflows or creating self-service private clouds, Iâ€™m here to demystify the process and make it accessible to everyone. Expect a mix of practical tips, thought-provoking insights. So grab your favorite keyboard (mineâ€™s is not mechanical, by the way ðŸ˜‰), and letâ€™s automate it. To the VSCode.

Thanks for stopping by!
